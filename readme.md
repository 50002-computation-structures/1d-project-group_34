### The Project

This project is a PvP arcade game where two players compete on a 4x4 grid to reach the goal first. Each player controls their position with four buttons: up, down, left, and right. Player positions are represented by white LEDs, restricted paths by red LEDs, and the goal by a green LED. There are three maps; pressing start transitions to the next map, briefly flashing it on both screens for one second before disappearing. Players must memorize each map quickly, navigating to the goal while avoiding restricted paths. The first to reach the goal wins; if the opponent wins, you lose automatically.

#### User Manual
Here's a step-by-step instruction set on how to play "Memory Maze: Grid Escape":  

Objective: The goal of the game is to reach the finishing zone on a 4x4 grid before your opponent, without touching any of the restricted grids. 

Setup: Two players stand in front of their respective 4x4 grid screens. 

Start: Host or either player presses start to begin the game. 

Memorization: Upon pressing start, the restricted grids will flash for a brief moment, 1 second, on the screens. Players must memorise the location of these restricted grids, as they must avoid them while navigating to the finishing zone. 

Navigation: Players use 4 buttons to move left, right, up, or down on the grid. They must navigate through the grid to reach the finishing zone. 

Winning: The first player to reach the finishing zone without touching any of the restricted grids wins the game. The other player automatically loses.
